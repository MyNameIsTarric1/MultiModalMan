\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\subsection{Key Achievements}

\textit{MultiModalMan} re-imagines the classic paper hangman as an inclusive digital game: players can now interact by speaking, gesturing, or typing, while an AI agent orchestrates the state machine, understands natural-language commands, and adapts hints in real timeâ€”making the experience accessible to a far wider audience than the original pencil-and-paper version ever reached.
