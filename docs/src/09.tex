\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\subsection*{Key Achievements}

\textbf{MultiModalMan} reimagines the classic paper hangman as an inclusive digital game: players can now interact by speaking, gesturing, or typing, while an AI agent orchestrates the state machine, understands natural language commands, and adapts hints in real time making the experience accessible to a far wider audience than the original pencil and paper version ever reached.
