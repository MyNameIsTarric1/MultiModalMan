\section{Project Outline}
This report is organised into nine chapters, each detailing a distinct stage in the development of \textit{MultiModalMan}. Together they guide the reader from the earliest requirements to the final evaluation and future prospects.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Chapter 1 — Introduction}\\
%           Purpose, scope and contributions of the project, with a roadmap for navigating the report.
    
%     \item \textbf{Chapter 2 — Requirements Analysis}\\
%           Functional and non-functional requirements distilled from stakeholder goals and user research.
    
%     \item \textbf{Chapter 3 — Use-Case Model}\\
%           Use-case diagram and textual scenarios that capture the intended user–system interactions.
    
%     \item \textbf{Chapter 4 — System Architecture}\\
%           Hardware and software stack, deployment view and responsibilities of the principal components.
    
%     \item \textbf{Chapter 5 — Architectural Implementation}\\
%           Package structure, key classes, control flow and sequence diagrams for core processes.
    
%     \item \textbf{Chapter 6 — User Interface Design \& Evaluation}\\
%           Evolution of the GUI from abstract prototypes to the final implementation, assessed against Nielsen’s heuristics.
